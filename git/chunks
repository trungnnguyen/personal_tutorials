Personal git tutorial
=====================

 1. Clone
   * git clone https://youngung@github.com/youngung/UPF.git

 2. Showing all branch with under remote repository
   * git branch -a

 3. To fork a branch from a remote repo called 'origin'
   * git checkout origin/experimental  #
   * git checkout -b experimental origin/experimental -> to work on that branch

 4. Fixing working on a wrong branch
   * git stash
   * git checkout example_branch
   * git stash apply

 5. Push to the remote 'origin'   
   * git push origin
   5-1. With tags.
    * git push origin --tags
   5-2. To push a new local branch
    * git push origin 'new branch name'

 6. Undo a commit and redo.
     $ git commit ...
     $ git reset --soft HEAD^      (1)
     $ edit                        (2)
     $ git commit -a -c ORIG_HEAD  (3)
       (1). This is most often done when you remembered what you just committed is incomplete, or you misspelled your commit message, or both. Leaves working tree as it was before "reset".
       (2). Make corrections to working tree files.
       (3). "reset" copies the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; redo the commit by starting with its log message. If you do not need to edit the message further, you can give -C option instead.

 7. Fetch
     * git fetch origin
     * git checkout --track origin/plugin

 8. Undo a merge
    - With git log check which commit is one prior the merge. Then you can reset it using:
      * git reset --hard commit_sha
    - There's also another way
      * git reset --hard HEAD~5
    - will get you back 5 commits.
